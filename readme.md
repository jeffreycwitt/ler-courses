# A Machine Actionable Course Catalogue

The most important task is to add task by which slices of courses can grouped and compared. 

# Reserved Tags

* "exclude"
  * add the exclude tag to any unique or one-off course that should be included from fill rate analysis
* "1stLevel"
  * reserved for classes that are considered a first level core course
* "2ndLevel"
  * reserved for classes that are considered a second level core course
* "Lab"
* "Seminar"
  * A catch all tag for major level courses. If that is not sufficiently refined, then new tags should be introduced.
* "Ethics"
* "Graduate"
  * reserved to designate a course as a graduate course. By default all courses are considered "Undergraduate". In other words, the "Undergraduate" tag will be applied to all courses that are NOT tagged "Graduate"
